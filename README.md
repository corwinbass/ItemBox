# ItemBox

Itembox is a plugin that basically gives players an item "mailbox" that persists over server restarts, and other players can send items to other player's mailboxes. Players can claim items from their mailbox anytime.

Admins can also send special Dynamic Boxes, which give a randomised set of items (configurable)
